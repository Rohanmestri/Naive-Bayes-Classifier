# Naive Bayes Classifier
Implemented a Naive Bayes Classifier in Python which is trained and tested on the UCI Machine Learning Repository - SPECT Heart Dataset.


 
## Dataset 
- The [Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spect+heart) is an Binary dataset which can be found in the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- The dataset is obtained from Single Proton Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) images and is processed down to 22 attributes with each attribute either being '0' or '1'.


## Installation
- git clone https://github.com/Rohanmestri/Naive-Bayes-Classifier.git

## How to use?
- In the src folder, run the NaiveBayes.py using the following arguments:
       python NaiveBayes.py [name_of_train_file] [name_of_test_file] 
       
- The code prints the accuracy on the test set and the confusion matrix for the test set.
